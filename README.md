Polaris
=======

Polaris is a framework greatly enhancing the Google Maps external framework. It aims to:

  * Make the user's life easier
  * Make the developer's life easier
  * Make the resulting map look polished and natural

Here are some interesting links you can use to discover Polaris:

  * **Polaris Sample**: A demo application demonstrating some features of the Polaris. It is available on the [Google Play][2]).
  * **Meet Polaris, a map library for Android**: A blog post I wrote to introduce the first version of the library. It contains a great description of the main features included in Polaris. You can read it on my [personal blog][3]).

Features
--------

  * Gesture support
  * Effortless map annotating
  * Map callout variable anchor positioning
  * Built-in “user tracking” mode
  * Automatic built-in zoom controls
  * Natural map callouts transitions
  * Additional listeners
  * And many more!

Limitations
-----------
Polaris is an extension of the Google Maps External Library and hence suffers from a lot of its limitations and bugs (`PolarisMapView` must be used in a `MapActivity`, only one instance of `PolarisMapView` is allowed per `MapActivity`, etc.).

While reducing the complexity of the library, `Polaris` made the use of `Overlay` almost useless by managing main `Overlay`s such as `MyLocationOverlay` and `ItemizedOverlay` internally. As a consequence, you must never use the `getOverlays()` method. `PolarisMapView` provides replacement methods such as `addOverlay(Overlay)`, `removeOverlay(Overlay)`, etc.

Usage
-----

  1. Include the PolarisMapView widget in your layout.

        <com.cyrilmottier.polaris.PolarisMapView
            android:id="@+id/polaris_map_view"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:apiKey="[YOUR_API_KEY]" />

  2. In your `onCreate` method, add/find the PolarisMapView to your layout.

         mPolarisMapView = (PolarisMapView) findViewById(R.id.polaris_map_view)
         
  3. Bind your `MapActivity`'s `onStart` and `onStop` method to the `PolarisMapView`
     equivalent.

        @Override
        protected void onStart() {
            super.onStart();
            mPolarisMapView.onStart();
        }
    
        @Override
        protected void onStop() {
            super.onStop();
            mPolarisMapView.onStop();
        } 

###Including In Your Project

The Polaris library is presented as an [Android library project][4]. You can include this project by [referencing it as a library project][5] in Eclipse or ant.

###Building the sample application

Using the Google Maps external library requires registering your signing key to Google. When doing so, Google generates an API key you must pass to `MapView` when instanciating. For obvious reasons, you must keep these keys private.

Logically, the sample application doesn't include API keys. In order to run the project correctly you must add a `LocalConfig.java` file in the `com.cyrilmottier.android.polarissample.util` package containing your own API keys:

    package com.cyrilmottier.android.polarissample.util;
    
    public final class LocalConfig {
    
        private LocalConfig() {
        }
    
        public static final String GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_RELEASE = "<YOUR_RELEASE_KEY>";
        public static final String GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_DEBUG = "<YOUR_DEBUG_KEY>";
    
    }

Clustering
----------

You can simply use the `Clusterer` to filter and give you a reduced set of `Annotation`s before adding to your `PolarisMapView`.

The `Clusterer` groups `Annotation` objects that overlap each other by projecting geolocation to a position on screen and then detecting pixel proximity. A single `Annotation` object will be used to represent overlapping `Annotation`s by replacing its map marker drawable with a cluster spot. This cluster spot will be a defined size and colour depending on how many `Annotation` objects it contains and the current `ClusterConfig` configuration.

e.g. in the sample below, a `Cluster` with
  * 4 or less `Annotation`s would be defined as Low and be displayed as a yellow circle
  * 5 - 8 `Annotation`s would be defined as Medium and be displayed as an orange circle
  * 9 or more `Annotation`s would be defined as High and be displayed as a red circle

```java    
    Clusterer clusterer = new Clusterer(mMapView, annotations, new ClusterConfig(4, 8));
    mMapView.setAnnotations(clusterer.getClusters(), R.drawable.map_pin_holed_blue);
```

The 'ClusterConfig' can also be used to completely customise the drawables (also text size & colour) used for high, medium and low cluster spots. See sample code for examples.
